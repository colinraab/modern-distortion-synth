# Modern Distortion Synthesizer

The Modern Distortion Synthesizer is a polyphonic wavetable synthesizer featuring four sources (two wavetable oscillators, a noise generator, and a sampler) with per-voice, per-source processing (filters, envelopes, and most importantly, distortion).

3rd place winner in the 2023 AES Saul Walker Student Design Competition.
